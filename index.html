		<p id="introtext">Welcome to our school web design project. As you can see, we have not done a lot. As such, we would appreciate it if you could please recite some Shakespeare for us, with lots of added burps. McDonalds McNuggets would be greatly appreciated as well. </p>
		<p id="loltext">If you're bored, read on!</p>
		<div id="essay-div">
			<p> School is something very familiar to all of us. We go every weekday for eight hours, then come home to do homework. We also know school to be very annoying, boring, and useless. Students would be able to learn much better in a much better environment than what is usually provided. Education is important, but it must reach the students. Schools would be much better for everyone, teachers and students alike, if some things were changed. </p>
			<p>First, the starting time. Elementary school starts at 8:30 AM or something similar. Middle school starts at 8:00 AM, and high school starts even earlier at 7:30 AM. Studies have shown that schools that start around or after 8:00 AM produce better, more successful students. If all schools' starting times were moved up by maybe a half an hour, students would be performing much better in school, leading to an enhanced education. </p>
			<p>Secondly, fire drills, lockdowns, etc. These are good in the sense that we are preparing for emergencies. The problem is, these happen drills happen once every month, while the actual emergencies happen perhaps once every decade or so. If the number of drills is cut down by even two thirds, much less time would be wasted outside preparing for a very rare event. </p>
			<p>Thirdly, lunch time. In elementary school and middle school, lunch is very short. Most of the time not even half an hour. In high school, it's better, with an hour of lunch. But, lunch time is a great time to eat, do homework, talk with friends, and many other things. In elementary and middle school, there is barely enough time to finish eating a slightly larger than average lunch. If lunch was extended to be 45 or 50 minutes, students would be more successful, being able to meet with more teachers, do more homework, and finish eating, all in one lunch. </p>
			<p>Fourthly, homework. Most if not all students groan when they hear this word. It takes time away from their activities at home, which they do not want. Some classes have extra time at the end when you can get a head-start on your homework, but not in every class. If there was a designated ten or so minutes at the end of each class for students to do homework, whether in that class or a different one, students would have less homework at home, and be able to study more at home, leading to better test grades. Teachers usually are able to cram an hour long lesson into thirty minutes when needed to, so if they could do that every single class period, there would be time left over for homework. </p>
			<p>Finally, transportion. Buses are great for after school conversations and doing homework..., unless there's barely room to breathe. On my bus, for example, the bus ride was very productive on the ride home, until a new stop was added by the school adminstration. Now, instead of a comfortable two people in a two and a half seater, we have to squeeze three people in that space, causing much discomfort. The main point of the ride now, instead of having fun and doing work, is surviving the ride home without suffocating. Also, there have been days where people had to be booted off the bus and picked up by their parents for there to be enough room for everyont to have at least an inch of seating space. If these bus routes were more thought out, none of these problems would exist. </p>
			<p>In conclusion, school has the potential to produce wonderful students, and the potential to be an enjoying experience, but many problems that exist limit it's effectiveness. </p>
